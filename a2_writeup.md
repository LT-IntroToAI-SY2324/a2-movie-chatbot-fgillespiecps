# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The difficult part about completing the match function was understanding what the function was doing. I needed to understand what my code was doing and the function to be able to write a match function successfully.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
I could use a match function to extract information from a movie database by using it to search for a specific movie. We can use values tied to all movies and then use them to find the specific movie in a movie database. We can organize the movie database by using multiple different values. The move values you add the more specific and more effective a database can be.
